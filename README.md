Hi, My name is Dhruv Mehta. I'm a PhD in Automotive Student at CU-ICAR under Dr. Venkat Krovi. My research focuses on enhanced mobility for Autonomous Ground Vehicles in off-road environment.
This repo consists of all the codes related to AuE8230 Autonomy Science and Systems taught by Dr. Venkat Krovi in Spring 2022.

Each Assignment/Project will be stored in Catkin_ws
Route is catkin_ws/src/assignments.

  For Assignment 2 it is:
    catkin_ws/src/assignment2_ws
    Turtlebot codes:
      assignment2_ws/turtlesim_cleaner/src
      1) Move in a circle - This code makes turtlebot sim move in a circle of constant angular velocity and radius of 3
